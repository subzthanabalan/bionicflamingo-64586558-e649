BionicFlamingo
==========

BionicFlamingo is your one-stop-shop for browsing fake books with silly titles.

The LIBRARY tab shows available books in the BionicFlamingo library, grabbed from the API. Tapping
on these items adds them to the QUEUE tab. Once there, tapping on a book leads to its detail page.
Book data are downloaded the first time the detail activity is opened. 

BionicFlamingo has been designed as an exercise repo to show what you know about developing an
Android app. Use any additional libraries you prefer, and take any liberties with it you'd like.

There are a number of tasks to be taken care of in this project, including bugs, features, and
improvements:

1. Bug: The QUEUE list is not updating when a new item is added from the LIBRARY (currently the user
has to force-quit and reopen the app).
2. Feature: Allow the user to delete books from their device and to remove them from their queue
(which should also delete them). This will entail DELETE requests and removing items from the DB.
3. Improvement: Show cover images for books in both lists.
4. Improvement: Indicate in the UI whether a library item has been queued, and whether a queue item
has been downloaded.
5. Improvement: Fill out the book detail activity with cover image, authors, and publisher.

Hint: There may be hidden bugs in the repo. Don't be alarmed if something isn't quite right!

Good luck!
